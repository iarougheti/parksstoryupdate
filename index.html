<h2>
  No matter which of San Francisco’s 36 neighborhoods someone lives in, they’re always less than a ten-minute walk from a public park — from the massive Golden Gate Park to the single tree in the Tenderloin National Forest.

  This easy access has made the smallest parks an invaluable and popular resource for isolated residents since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as parks nonprofits around the city have found in recent months. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “Most people didn't feel comfortable going into each other's homes for the vast majority of the last two years,” said Rachel Kovinsky, who works in marketing and special events at the San Francisco Parks Alliance. “People really do gather in these spaces and use them as an alternative to a backyard or a living room.”
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Managing greenspace use in San Francisco increasingly means getting creative about creating and promoting miniature park spaces, said Kearstin Krehbiel, who works in development at the San Francisco Parks Alliance. The Parks Alliance and other nonprofits hope these local oases will remain popular as the pandemic’s late stages unfold.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “Parks […] are one of the most democratic institutions in our country,” Krehbiel said. “It's public land, and it's made available for everybody to use… they are accessible and vibrant and reflective of the communities that they serve.”

  Krehbiel said that people tend to associate parks with the wide-open space often required for physical activities or group meetups. As stay-at-home orders lifted in early 2021, the city focused on enthralling those whose relationships to parks have become hyper-local, centering more intimate schedules and hobbies.

  This started with a slate of recurring programming in mini-parks, from coordinating sidewalk chalk campaigns to commissioning local artists to construct miniaturized fairy gardens to place near the life-sized play equipment.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “[During COVID,] a lot of our normal life was disrupted. And so that forced people in a very, like, real, tangible, physical way to stay home and explore what they can walk to,” said Krehbiel.  
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  Shared spaces — public recreation spaces that aren’t necessarily parks but which multiple businesses or groups can use for events and art — have become more popular, as have “slow streets” where walkers and joggers can pass without vehicle traffic.
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  Recently, the Parks Alliance partnered with the San Francisco Bike Coalition to sponsor a night ride through Golden Gate Park. Riders, dressed in glow-in-the-dark clothing, celebrated the park’s bike culture, which has been thriving, partly because sections of the main road have been closed to vehicle traffic.

  Along the western edge of the city, the Great Highway trail and bike path in Outer Sunset saw a major expansion when the highway closed to cars during the pandemic. The highway remains closed on weekends, and the Great Highway has become the city’s second most popular park, according to Krehbiel. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  While Krehbiel and some park visitors are especially excited that road closure clears the way for younger riders in particular to practice biking, some longtime cyclists worry that turning roadways into park spaces presents accessibility problems. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  One biker, Andrew S., who requested omission of his full last name, said that closing the Great Highway would make the park unreachable to visitors from east San Francisco who would have had to drive there. This is especially difficult, he said, those from neighborhoods already underserved by SF’s municipal transit system. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “It was nice that [the Great Highway] was closed for biking reasons,” said Andrew, who recently moved back to Outer Sunset. “But I have a lot of political views about this as far as how space is used or how I use space.”

  Kovinsky said that the city’s most successful park revitalization projects have integrated new fitness and play facilities into beloved neighborhood spaces, rather than importing completely new infrastructure that ignores a land plot’s past life.
</p>



<p class="body-text">
  One of the group’s most recent projects revamped a SOMA alleyway, under what used to be a sky bridge connecting two department stores. The 500-block of Stevenson Street where the project sits was pure concrete. The SF Parks Alliance noticed that it was situated in an area with a high density of children but a low density of recognized parks or recreational areas, Krehbiel said. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  The team focused on appealing to children and how they might engage with a larger park. They brought in a basketball hoop, string lights and murals, and organized a long series of vendors and entertainers to bring the new space to life.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “There is a crazy amount of history that I can go on for a while about in parks here, but it would have to be specific to how every park has such a story,” Kovinsky said. “People just really use their parks here.”

  Parks for All
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Some SF parks are decades or centuries old, but Krehbiel said that in the last 20 years or so, she’s seen developers approach construction and revitalization projects with more of an equity mindset. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  Looking ahead, Krehbiel said the Parks Alliance predicts a continued focus on building recreational spaces in areas which were previously industrial. The greatest successes the group has had in creating community-driven spaces, she said, have come from identifying poorly maintained parks or disused areas around the city, and working backwards to understand the new needs of residents nearby.

<p class="body-text">
  Such an understanding usually comes two-fold. Structurally, developers must consider how systemic disadvantages like redlining and gentrification have shaped green-space access in different neighborhoods over time.
</p>


<p class="body-text">
  Then, they’re curious about what features would help kids see repurposed spaces, from grass to asphalt, as canvas for imaginative play.
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  In Krehbiel’s experience, this collaboration is unique to San Francisco parks. 
</p>

<p class="body-text">
  “There's a community design process that's part of every playground in San Francisco, so that the locals who live in that neighborhood get to say, you know, ‘I want something that's more like a woodland theme,’” she said. “I mean, we've got an airplane in a playground, we've a purple dragon that was designed by the community that's in a playground in San Francisco.”
